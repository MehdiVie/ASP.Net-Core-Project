                    The Baraye Azadi Group initiated its political activism in 2018 (initially under the name Iranian 
                    National Solidarity) in Vienna, Austria.
                    <br /><br />
                    This group perceives the only path to Iran's freedom as the overthrow and downfall of the 
                    entirety of the Islamic Republic regime, including all its branches and agents, such as the 
                    Supreme Leader (Ayatollah Khamenei)'s office, the Revolutionary Guard, all suppressive intelligence and military
                    agencies inside and outside the country, reformists, moderates, regime lobbyists (like NIAC), counterfeit 
                    opposition, and all rights violators and profiteers who feed off the blood of the Iranian people.
                    <br /><br />
                    The Baraye Azadi Group staunchly adheres to four principles: secularism, democracy, territorial integrity, and a referendum to determine the type of political system by the Iranian people (after the overthrow).
                    The Baraye Azadi Group believes that only through unity around the axis of Iranism and nationalism can victory be achieved over the demonic Islamic Republic. Based on this principle, Prince Reza Pahlavi is considered the most deserving individual currently for leading and guiding the movement for the freedom of the Iranian people, due to his belief in Iranism, nationalism, democracy, secularism, territorial integrity, and also a referendum to determine the type of government by the Iranian people (after the overthrow).
